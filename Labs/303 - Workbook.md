 # PROJECT PREPARATION WORKBOOK

A final year project companion

---

This workbook is personal to you, you don’t need to show it to anyone or hand it in as coursework. It is designed to help you think through the preparation and conduct of your final year project. The exercises and questions _sort of_ track the weekly sessions we have for the project modules – however. I will be adding to it as the weeks progress and as we think of new things to think about.

## Getting Started

### Personal Audit

There can be nothing worse than starting out on a project and realising that you are just not that interested in it. This is a real motivation killer and can lead to poor performance when undertaking the project.

Some students are lucky – they know, when they start their final year exactly what they want to work on. The rest of us need to audit our interests to narrow down topics we might turn into a project. If we can find a topic that inspires us, fascinates, or excites us, we are half-way to conducting a positive, high scoring, project.

Write down your answer to the following questions:

```ad-question
In your current or previous studies was there a particular topic or class that you found exciting or inspiring (and not just because it was easy) that you might take forwards in a project?
```



---

```ad-question
Do you have any hobbies or personal interests that you could involve in a project? (for example, a student might be passionate about dangers to the natural environment in their home country. Could they use what they have learned about data science to answer some questions about pollution or species diversity that might be useful findings for the government of their country)
```



---

```ad-question
Is there a skill or ability that you would like to develop that conducting a research project might help with?
```



---

```ad-question
What activities do you like doing most when studying? (e.g. reading, coding, making things, interacting with people …)
```


### Possible topic areas

Having conducted the personal audit – are you able to think of a topic area that might be a good starting point for a project idea?

```ad-question
Write down your topic idea:
```



---

Now try the following questions:

```ad-question
Are there any topics in computing that are really important right now (“Hot Topics”) that might give me some ideas of my own?
```



---

```ad-question
What sort of research does my favourite lecturer do?
```



---

```ad-question
What do I need to find out before I can ask a sensible question about this topic?
```



---

```ad-question
Does this topic relate to the employment direction I want to go in?
```



---

```ad-question
Write down your initial ‘research question’
```
>Don’t worry, at this stage, if the question you ask is broad or vague – it is a starting point. In the next section we will work on refining your idea.


---

### Achievability checklist

A sort of reality check to your initial question:

```ad-question
Is this a question that I can find out my own answers to (not simply present the answers that other people have found by looking at the internet or searching the library?)

yes/no (if no, think of another question)
```



---

```ad-question
Is this a question that I could find an answer to in the two semesters I have available for the project?
    
Yes/no (if no, think of another question)
```



---

```ad-question
Is this a question that I would need a considerable budget or resources to complete and therefore is not possible as a project?
    
Yes/no (if no, think of another question)
```

## The Choice

I hope section 1 helped you to identify a topic that you would find interesting to carry out a project in. At this point you need to make a simple choice:

>Do I want to conduct a project that would involve a practical or real-world activity (e.g. building a software or mobile application, solving a data problem for a company, designing a system that implements some data processing components)?

**OR**

>Do I want to pursue a more ‘pure’ style of research question (e.g., can data mining reveal a correlation between two groups of data, or measure the impact of phenomenon X on population Y)?

In either case you are going to need to boil the project down to a testable research question e.g.

-   ‘Does the password monitoring mobile application reduce the number of security breaches in users’ personal data?’
    
-   ‘Is there a positive correlation between educational attainment in the schools of X city and crime statistics in that city?’
    
-   ‘Can implementing an AI decision algorithm reduce product supply times for company x?’

```ad-question
So, which is it to be? A Practical or Pure project?
```


  
  

### A first attempt at a research question…

So now, if you have a topic area and have made a choice between practical project work or pure research, try to formulate a question for the project. Don’t worry if it is a bit broad or vague, or you are not quite sure about specifics, just write down a question that you would attempt to answer in an final year project:


## Refining the question and reducing the scope

You can refine the question that you have come up with by applying the following three steps:

### Does the question have more than one focus? If so, reduce it to a single focus.

For example, consider: 
>This project assesses the online security systems of Universities around the world and examines if students who “bring their own devices” represent a vulnerability to the security of University online systems.

This is an interesting topic, but it requires, AT LEAST, two research projects – one to assess University online security systems and one to examine students that “bring their own devices”. This would not be possible to achieve in the time available – so reframe the question to have a single focus: “This project examines how “bring your own device” may compromise the security of university online systems”. Now this could be carried out as a single research project.

  
  

### Localisation

In the example above the project mentions Universities (plural) and students (plural). As we know there are 25000 Universities around the world, and millions of students, the research question is TOO BIG to be achievable. Localisation is the process of reframing the question to an achievable level by limiting your study to the subjects available. So, let’s try the following:

>This project examines the “bring your own device” practices of a group of 90 Ethical Hacking students at Coventry University, to identify if these practices create vulnerabilities to the University’s online systems.

Now – you have a project where you can access the relevant students and consult a single University IT department.

  
  

### Granularisation

Granularisation is a process for splitting a project into multiple parts and conducting only one of them. So, in the example above – if you would be required to conduct a survey of the students AND penetration test the security of their laptops – it might be more achievable to conduct the survey OR the penetration tests but not both.

  
  

  
  

### Concluding Task

Rewrite the question that you posed under “A first attempt at a research question” to ensure it has a single focus and has reduce in scope until you are confident that you could carry this project out in 13 weeks and with relatively few resources:
