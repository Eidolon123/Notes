**Snoopers Charter**

Allows the UK authorities to run wild by:
-	bulk collecting communications data
-	targeted and bulk interception of communications
-	targeted and bulk equipment interference (hacking)

Requires CSP to retain connection records for 1 year.

It can be harder to perform these actions on journalists, lawyers and doctors.
