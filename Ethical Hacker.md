## The Hats

The difference between a white hat and black hat is that white hats have permission to do what they do and comply with all the relevant [[Laws]] and regulations. When executing [[Pentest]]s or [[red team]] attacks it is vital that the ethical hacker stay within organised [[Scope (Pentest)|scope]]. An ethical hacker also acts within the best interest of the organisation and treats all information discovered as [[Confidentiality|confidential]].

## Skills

Ethical Hackers will often need to have a base knowledge of the full span of digital technologies as clients could be using anything in their setups. This need for a broad knowledge base is why ethical hacking is usually a team effort. Each member of the team will specialise in one or two aspects of ethical hacking and as a team will be able to deal with any situation they find in the field.

### Soft Skills

While it is okay to specialise in specific areas, all ethical hackers should posses the correct soft skills to enable them to act efficiently in a team setting.
