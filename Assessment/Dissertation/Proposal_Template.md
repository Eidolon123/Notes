**1 Project Title & Research Question**

**Help:** The project title is a statement based on your research question. For example, the research question _'to what extent does a mobile application reduce the number of errors made in class registers at Coventry University in comparison to current paper-based registers'_ may be stated in the project title_: "A Wi-Fi driven mobile application for large group registers"._ **Try to ensure your research question is achievable by a student over a single semester. Try not to ask a research question that could not be carried out under this circumstance.**

 **2** **Project Topic**

**Help:** Describe the topic area in computing that you are personally interested in and that relates to the subject of your course. Try to be specific and identify a topic that is not so broad that you would have difficulty covering it in a one semester project module. Example 1: As a topic ‘E-Commerce’ is too broad – a more specific topic might be ‘Utilising a novel Neural Network Algorithm to improve product recommendations’. Example 2: As a topic ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is too broad – a more specific topic might be ‘detecting plagiarism in student reports utilizing data mining’.

**3 Expected Outputs**

Describe the outputs you expect the project to produce (a project report is taken as a given) such as demonstrator software, results from an experiment, survey results with recommendations for action, data mining outputs, a computer game level or shader method, a multimedia gallery or web framework, a demonstrator phone app, a business analysis report.

**4 Motivation for the project: Client or Audience.**

**Help:** Why is this project important? To whom is this project important? A project must address a research question that generates a small piece of new knowledge. This new knowledge must be important to a named group or specific client to make it worthwhile carrying out. This is the motivation for your project. In this section you should address who will benefit from your findings and how they will benefit. (note: ‘greater knowledge about’ is defined as a benefit – even if your audience is mainly other academic researchers, new data, if collected using scientific principles, adds to the body of knowledge about the topic). A problem-based project (i.e. where you work on a solution for a ‘real world’ client or need) is obviously important to a client or user group. How are you going to evaluate whether your solution is successful?

**4 Primary Research Plan**

**Help:** This is the plan as to how you will go about conducting your project - It must include a primary research method (an extended literature review is not an acceptable primary method). Think and plan logically. Primary methods may include experiments, applications or software demonstrators, process models, surveys, analysis of generated data … you may wish to suggest a timeline/Gantt Chart (covering the semester) or simply a sequence of tasks. Where you intend to collect data estimate how much data you need and how long the collection process will take. Make reasonable assumptions about the amount of work you can do and try not to ‘over-promise’ on results – most scientific research is small scale and time limited, this is even more the case with student projects where you also have competing modules.

  

# Part two: Mini literature review

**1 Initial Literature Review**

**Help text:** Using the University Library e-journal database, or the ACM portal database, identify and select between three and five research papers relating to your topic. Try and identify papers that are current (within the last three years). A literature review is a select analysis of existing research which is relevant to your topic. It **_explains and justifies_** how your investigation may help answer some of the questions or gaps in this area of research. A literature review is not a straightforward summary of everything you have read on the topic and it is not a chronological description of what was discovered in your field. Use your literature review to:

· Show how your project will relate to previous studies.

· Compare and contrast different authors' views on an issue - note areas in which authors disagree.

· Highlight current key studies

· Highlight any gaps in research that may provide you with a starting point for your project

· Highlight any good approaches that may allow you to develop a project idea further

The key to the mini-literature review is your critical and evaluative perspective on the literature reviewed. **_Use the review to make a case or argument as to why your own research project is necessary/important._**

**2 Bibliography (key texts from your literature review)**

**Help:** Please provide references, in correct APA style, for the research papers that have informed your literature review. The references should be recent (three years) and sufficiently technical or academic. Your markers will be looking for you to identify technical reports, conference papers, and journal papers. Avoid _Wikipedia_ entries, newspaper reports that do not cite sources, and general or introductory texts.
