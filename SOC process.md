### SOC process

- Asset discovery
	- need to know where all machines are, maintaining up to date inventory of all assets
		- run active and passive scans on the network to get full picture of network
	- need to know business process, which machines should or should not be communicating
	- need to know which systems are critical assets, potential pathways 
		- also machines these rely on
	- network infrastructure
	- where to set up monitors
- event classification and triage
	- collecting correlating and analysing traffic/log/etc
		- filter out false positive
		- pick up on IOCs
		- automation is critical
	- when event happens first thing is triage
	- need to decide which events are higher priority or can be looked at later
	- no event ignored, some just more urgent
	- **everything** should be documented
		- need to revisit situations to learn lessons
		- need docs in case of formal legal/disciplinary actions
-	prioritisation and analysis
	-	focus on most impactful events
		-	is attack opportunistic or targets APT attack?
	-	earlier stage questions:
		-	who
		-	what
		-	where
		-	this intel is vital if attackers return to attack again
-	remediation and recovery
	-	Quick ID and response is critical
-	assessment and audit
-	assessing the organisation security posture
-	can involve pentesting
