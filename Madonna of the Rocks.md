The *Madonna of the rocks* painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is the original version of the painting held in the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[France]]. This version was rejected by the commissioner due to many factors. A later version called [[Virgin of the Rocks]] was painted and accepted, it now hangs in [[London]]s [[National Gallery]].
