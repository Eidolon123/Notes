## Switches

Part of the network within which frames that have collided are propagated.

Devices such as repeaters and hubs propagate collisions.

[[Switches]] allow for breaking down collision domains.
Layer 2 addresses ([[Mac Address]]) allow for micro segmentation.


Switches do NOT subnet domains.


- On restart switching table is empty
- if port unknown then message is broadcast to network, hoping correct host receives message
- if correct host replies this port is added to switching table.

**Throughput**: overall speed of switch

**Forwarding rate**: packets per second switched

Not all switches with same ports/speeds/etc will perform the same


##### Symmetric vs Asymmetric

Symmetric switches have the same bandwidth on all ports

Asymmetric switches have one or more ports that are faster than other ports


##### Methods

Asymmetric switches have to use store and forward where the entier packet before forwarding

Symmetric switches can use fast forward where the packet is sent as soon as possible (as soon as dest is known). They can also use fragment free .....


##### Buffers

Buffers are used to store packets temp, this can be used when:
- dest port busy
- diff in port speed

Two approaches are one buffer for all ports, or 1 buffer for 1 port


### Redundancy

A method of building fault tolerance

### Graph Theory

## VLAN
