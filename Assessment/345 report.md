# How can small to medium businesses adopt IoT  devices and still stay secure.

## Abstract

As time passes, along with external factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic, IoT devices are being further and further integrated into both the lives of individuals and the running of businesses. This trend is only going to increase over the coming years, along with the need for devices and systems to be more efficient and easy to use for the masses. This paper will address IoT device security flaws and how they could leave the businesses that use them at risk of attack, IoT device's potential benefits to the business, and how best to implement them with a focus on security.

## 1 Introduction

Depending on the type of business being ran the IoT devices being adopted can vary significantly along with the security issues that they bring with them.  
When it comes to IoT devices a premium is often placed on availability followed by integrity and finally  confidentiality (Harper et al., 2018).

## 2 Types of IoT Devices

### Industrial IoT

Industrial IoT or IIoT refers to the application of IoT connected devices in industrial applications such as manufacturing, assembly and logistics (Trend Micro, n.d)

### Smart Devices

These types of IoT devices have seen a massive growth in the past few years with Amazon's Alexa and similar "smart assistants". Door locks, door bells, alarms, blah blah blah.  

## 3 IoT communication types

### NB-IoT



## 4 Security Concerns

### 4.1 Availability

Having an over-reliance on interconnected devices presents issues when services are interrupted or go down, take the large Facebook outage in October of 2021 for example. While the initial outage was caused by a command accidentally making Facebook and related domains unreachable, the outage was prolonged by employees being unable to access the building to fix the issue. This was because the access card points were IoT devices that no longer functioned due to the outage. Taking this example we can theorise an attack vector on companies that utilise a similar method of building entry. 

### 4.2 System resources

These small and low powered systems often lack the resources necessary to run encryption algorithms and other security mechanisms.

## 5 Mitigations

### 5.1 IoT-Sphere

### 5.2 SD-WAN

### 5.3 Machine Learning

## 6 Conclusion
