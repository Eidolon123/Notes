## Question 1 - Detecting reconnaissance from insider threats

### What data should be collected and where

Insider threats are potentially more likely to target high value systems as they already have an in-depth working knowledge of the company network/systems. Once they have decided on their target they will undertake reconnaissance on their target to further increase their knowledge of the system and formulate plans for exploitation and extraction. This is shown as stage 4 in the timeline of insider attacks laid out by CISA below.

Initial reconnaissance attempts by the attacker are likely to be passive. Passive reconnaissance in this context would include them interacting with employees that are closer to the target system and using third-party software like Wireshark to perform network reconnaissance. Detecting these indicators of impending insider threat will involve 

Active reconnaissance will involve the attacker using more obvious techniques to gather information. These techniques include port-scanning, fingerprinting, and enumeration (Mazurczyk & Caviglione, 2021). This type of reconnaissance attempts can be detected by 

Inter-Employee communications

Technological and human based monitoring



### What tools and what activity

Implementing an end-point security monitoring (ESM) solution in employee workstations

### Strats to help overcome scale

## Question 2 -  Statistical Data Collection

## Question 3 - Snort or Zeek?
what protocol analysis and content searching/matching features does it offer?

- Snort

Snort has been in use throughout the security industry for over 20 years, cementing it as the go to option for most companies. Snort can operate in three different modes: Sniffer, packet logger and network intrusion detection. As the client is looking to deploy an IDS solution they will most likely be setting snort up as an NIDS. 

Snort operates via a rule based language, these rules are grouped by protocol, then port, then if the rule has content or not (Fortinet, n.d.). If the rule has content then snort can perform content matching on packets using the Boyer-Moore pattern match function (Roesch, n.d.). This process enables the security team operating the snort instance to efficiently find specific patterns in packets that indicate a compromise or vulnerability in their systems.
The value that snort provides to the security team directly correlates to the quality of the rules written for it. 

Snort being an open-source tool with an extremely large amount of community support and community written rules, along with the tools long standing reputation, make it a very popular and safe choice for anyone wanting to implement it into their security arsenal.
