## Notes on the brief

Your proposal should also address compliance with relevant national and international standards and regulations.

setup a Managed Services SOC (SOC-as-a-Service) in your company which will provide dedicated services (remotely) to the companies in the TTEVâ€™s supply chain.

should be clear, concise, legible and interesting.

Diagrams are good for presenting a lot of information.

TTEV has to share sensitive information across its supply chain (e.g. car part designs and specifications)

## Supply chain definition

Hardware and software, cloud or local storage and distribution mechanisms

## Sections

Need to make sure 3rd party code from suppliers hasn't been tampered with before being used.

- [[OSSEC]]
- [[Kismet]]

### Threat intelligence

- Dedicated team
- Darknet monitoring for info about company or people looking for info

### Indications of compromise

### Reports

- Brief overview of how reports will be structured

### What guidelines?

### Keeping systems online while SOC is implemented

### Governance

### Collaborative cyber security

### Examples of previous attacks

#### Watering hole attacks

A watering hole attack utilises a website that the victim already uses and is familiar with. This site is then targeted in order to infect the victims machine, launching a pivot attack towards the rest of the network. This could compromise the entire supply chain.

This could be mitigated by restricting the use of personal websites on corporate systems with a blacklist.

### Using the ELK stack
