-----------------------------------------------

Host based  open source IDS. Runs on a client/server architecture, this means that we only deploy agents to the host machine, they collect the data and send it back to the server in order for it to be processed. The forensic evidence is then only on the server not on the host machine.

This tool can monitor:
- File integrity
- System logs
- Software installs
- Network Connections

Alerts can be then be generated from any of these.
