Client: Software development company (SDC)
Industry: Software development


## Pre-engagement Interactions

### Communication with the client

All communication should take place either face to face or via encrypted methods. In this case PGP encryption should be used for forms such as email. This includes the communication of the final report.

### [[Scope-pentest|Scope]]

The range of IP addresses that fall within the [[Scope-pentest|scope]] should be agreed with the client. It should also be verified that all target environments belong to the client, as they might outsource management of these devices to a third party. The location of these environments should also be verified as the [[Laws]] surrounding the test can change from area to area.

The [[Scope-pentest|scope]] for this pentest includes the entire IT infrastructure, systems and employees.

![[345-lab2.png]]

- 50x PC running windows 8.1/10 
- 2x windows 2008 servers
	- Code repository ***CRITICAL***
	- File & Print
- 2x Laser Jet printers (M4555 / CM4540)
- 1x Windows SQL 2005 server ***CRITICAL***
- 1x WiFi Access Point
	- Security: WPA2
	- SSID: CYBERWIFI
	- PASS: AB14F622
- 1x Apache web server (Ubuntu)
	- In the [[DMZ]]

The code repo server and SQL backend have been assumed to be critical systems, the client should be interviewed to find out if other systems are considered critical.

### Goals

#### Primary

- Access to windows 2008 servers with a focus on the code repo
- Access to SQL backend either through the webserver or network
- Access to Windows PCs

#### Secondary

-	Enumeration of user/customer data from SQL server


### Rules of Engagement

#### Location

It is assumed that all targets that fall under this scope are located in the same building it should be unnecessary for any testers to travel to any other location.

SDC address:

```
Address line 1
county
postcode
country
```

#### Time of week/day

As employees are under the scope it would be best for testing to take place on a weekday within business hours.

### Permission to test

A document containing the full scope, possible side effects of testing, etc. should be provided to the client and signed. This is to make sure the pentesting company is not liable. As all systems are owned by the client there is no need to seek permission to test from any third party companies.
