```



## Task 2

```ad-question
title: SOC from a business perspective
Consider the following:

From a business perspective, what are the key business functions of a SOC?

From a service management perspective, what key IT services would support the key business functions?

From an IT management perspective, what key IT systems are needed to support those services?
```



## Task 3a

```ad-question
title: SOC and ITSM
Pick one of the ITILv3 stages (strategy, design, transition, operation or CSI) and discuss in the comments section three ways in which that stage intersects with and influences the SOC’s policies, processes and procedures.
For that stage discuss one way in which the SOC should influence, guide or enforce policies, processes or procedures in the wider organisation.
```



## Task 3b

```ad-question
title: SOC and governance
The ISO 38500:2015 standard gives six principles that say the ‘what’ which the IT governance should try to achieve, but does not give the ‘how’.
Pick any one of those principles, and using the three parts of the model, give four ways in which the SOC could help implement the how.
