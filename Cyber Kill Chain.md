	-	run [[Threat Intelligence]], looking at [[Darknet]] for info being sold and distributed about the organisation. Or anyone looking for information about the company.
-	weaponisation
	-	after IDing weakness will create tailor made [[malware]] and tools to attack the target
-	delivery
	-	using the attack vector

Making the lives of attackers difficult at each step will make it more likely to detect an attack.
