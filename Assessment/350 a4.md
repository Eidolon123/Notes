According to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity report on the threat landscape for supply chain attacks, supply chain attacks are meant to increase by 4x in the remainder of 2021 (ENISA, 2021). Due to this increase, attacks are likely to become more advanced with bespoke, custom malware. This is why an NIDS with signature based detection along side behavioural analysis abilities will give us an edge in the growing threat landscape.
