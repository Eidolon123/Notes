title: NSM Task
The university has built a Studentsâ€™ Halls of Residence accommodating a few hundred students. Internet for the student rooms is provided by connecting them to the university network. The IT department is considering running separate NSM operations for the new building.

Your task is to recommend what type of data (full packet, session or statistical) should be collected. You should also describe what exactly is to be collected and why.

You will need to take into account the technical, legal and ethical issues in your proposal.
