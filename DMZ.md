### DMZ

A demilitarized zone (DMZ) refers to a host or network that acts as a secure and intermediate network or path between an organization's internal network and the external, or non-propriety, network.

A DMZ serves as a front-line network that interacts directly with the external networks while logically separating it from the internal network.

A demilitarized zone may also be known as a network perimeter or perimeter network.
