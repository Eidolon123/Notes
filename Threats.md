# Threats

Cyber attacks can be separated into three main categories:

## Technical Attacks

An attack from an outside source, usually targeting vulnerabilities in systems employed by the target organisation.

## Social Engineering

An attack that targets the employees of a company through various tactics:

-	Tailgating: Following someone into a building or doorway in order to bypass the need to gain an ID card or access device.
-	Baiting: An attack where the target is provided something that would be of use to them but is in fact something malicious. 
-	Phishing: An attack where the attacker assumes the identity of an authority figure or organisation in order to get the target to give them sensitive information.
-	Whaling: Similar to phishing but targeted at specific individuals that are usually high up in an organisation. These attack usually come with a lot more prep time than regular phishing.
-	Scareware: Where the target is shown lots of false alarms and notifications in order to convince them that their machine has already been compromised. The attackers then use this to get the target to install software that actually compromises the machine. This attack technique works best on less technologically literate people.

## Insider Threats

An attack that misuses the trust relations within an organisation (rogue actor).

## Threat methods

Threat methods are constantly evolving over time to avoid current defense mechanisms.

Many attacks are unpredictable:
	-	file-less
	-	malware-less
	-	complex anti-detection
	-	anti-forensics
	-	multistage

70% of attacks are opportunistic and done by automatic tools
-	29% are persistent targeted well organised attacks, will not back down.
