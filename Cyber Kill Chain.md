## The cyber kill chain

developed by Lockheed Martin as part of intelligence driven defense, the stage of an attack:
-	recon
	-	Need to control leaks of information from employees
	-	run threat intel, looking at darknet for info being sold and distributed about the organisation. Or anyone looking for information about the company.
-	weaponisation
	-	after IDing weakness will create tailor made malware and tools to attack the target
-	delivery
	-	using the attack vector
-	installation
-	command and control
	-	lateral movement, persistence, etc

Making the lives of attackers difficult at each step will make it more likely to detect an attack.
