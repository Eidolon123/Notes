## Notes on the brief

Your proposal should also address compliance with relevant national and international standards and regulations.

setup a Managed Services SOC (SOC-as-a-Service) in your company which will provide dedicated services (remotely) to the companies in the TTEVâ€™s supply chain.

should be clear, concise, legible and interesting.

Diagrams are good for presenting a lot of information.

TTEV has to share sensitive information across its supply chain (e.g. car part designs and specifications)
