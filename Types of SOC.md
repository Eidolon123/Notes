# Types of SOC

- in-house SOC
	- mainly used by large organisations (banks, ISPs, large companies)
	- expensive
- virtual soc
	- medium sized organisation
	- comprised of IT team members and other employees
		- as and when something happens these other employees are pulled to act as a SOC
- managed security service provider (mssp or SOCaaS)
	- Contracted by other organisations to act as a remote SOC
	- one of the most common SOC solutions
- collaborative cyber security
	- teaming up of multiple SOCs to work together
	- for example all energy companies in the UK would link their SOCs together so if one company is attacked, all other companies would start to monitor for the same threat
	- good for detecting attack campaigns
