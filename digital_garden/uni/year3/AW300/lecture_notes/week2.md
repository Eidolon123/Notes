# The writing process

## 1 - Brainstorming and narrowing down

how to identify research questions?

## 2 - Desk research

- Accumulation knowledge
- comparing and contrasting sources with one another and with own ideas
- discuss ideas with supervisor and colleagues
- refine research questions
- write literature reviews

## 3 - Identify the nature structure of your dissertation

- Empriical research


## Writing groups

- small group
- share plans, sections of, or whole drafts of your assignment with each other, for feedback
- will provide guidance

## Task 1: Keeping a writing log (10 mins)

Keep a [[writing-log]] about what has happened on the dissertation so far, any progress made on any front. Should ideally be done weekly, not huge, just a couple of lines about progress made or upcoming tasks that need to be tackled.


## Goal Setting

> Setting short term and long term goals is highly effective

### Short Term

-	before stating to write, think about what you want to achieve by the end of the day/week
-	be realistic
-	revisit goals at the end of the day/week
-	reflect on the goals if you did or did not achieve them

## Planning your writing


## Task 2: Your previous coursework writing (10 mins)

### What did we do?

- Types of work completed
	- Presentation
	- Essay
	- Report
	- VIVA
	- Write-Ups

### Two different generes

#### Report (245)

A more academic style report about two topics in cyber security, how they link together and what issues they pose.

- Broken into two main sections (The two topics) which were then broken down into 4-5 sections each. This made it easier to write each section, complete it and move onto the next.
- My writing process for this was not great, maily cramming it into the last week or two.
- As it was a more objective style report on current issues in the comunity it was easier for me to come up with ideas based around others research.


#### VIVA (ALL)

This was a self relective piece of writing about what we had covered during the ALL module.

- Reflective
- Critical
- Broken into three questions: what we had done, what we struggled with, what we will do to improve.
- As this was a more descriptive piece about previous tasks completed, the writing process was fairly straight forward.  

## Dissertation evalutation criteria

- unique selling point/originality in terms of subject, method, evidence and arguments
- In-depth thinking and critical evaluation

### Other aspects
- Research design, data collection, ethics
- Conclustions in the form of summary, solution and further research
- formal features
	- length
	- macro/micro organisation
	- academic style
	- layout
	- grammatical soundness



## Task 3:
