Gaining the upper hand in a security situation is increasingly involving the need to respond to potential threats. This is where Threat Intelligence comes into play, to guide the actions of the [[Security Operations Centre (SOC)|SOC]].

Usually only large SOC teams will undertake threat intelligence and is usually outsourced. In the UK the national [[Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT)|CERT]] is the National Cyber Security Centre.

Threat intelligence can be sourced through many means, these include:

- Social Media
- [[Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT)]]
- Vendor Briefings
- Observation of our own systems
- [[Darknet]]
