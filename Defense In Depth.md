Making sure we make attackers lives difficult along every step of the [[Cyber Kill Chain]]. Starting with the asset in the centre, we should build layer upon layer of security enforcement (policy/processes/tools/etc). This will combine soft and hard security efforts.

## Layers

### Network based

- [[Firewall]]
- [[Intrusion Detection Systems]]
- [[Infection Prevention Systems]]

### Host based

- Anti-Virus
- [[End-Point Detection Response]]

### General

- Employee awareness
- Policies and Procedures

## Correlation

Results from security systems need to be correlated in the [[Security Operations Centre (SOC)|SOC]].
