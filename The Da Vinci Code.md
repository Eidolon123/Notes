The Da Vinci Code is a book I started reading on 29/09/2021. It is a [[thriller]] / [[drama]] written by [[Dan Brown]] and published in 2003.

So far it has covered themes of [[Cryptography]], [[Paganism]], [[symbolism]], and [[religion]], specifically [[Christianity]]. The [[Opus Dei]] section of the [[Catholic Church]] and the secret society [[Priory of Sion]], of which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a member, feature heavily. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]s works feature heavily in the book also.

I've particularly enjoyed the use of [[anagrams]] with double meanings such as "So dark the con of man" > "[[Madonna of the Rocks]]" and "o draconian devil, oh lame saint" > ""

[[Robert Langdon]] is the main character in the book, so far using his skills in [[symbolism]] to decipher cryptic clues left by a dead member of the [[Priory of Sion]]. The dead member of the sect was a curator at the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[France]]. He was also [[Sophie Neveu]]s grandfather. [[Sophie Neveu]] is [[Robert Langdon]]'s female counterpart in the book, she works in the [[Cryptography]] department in the french police and uses her skills to help [[Robert Langdon]] solve the mystery.
