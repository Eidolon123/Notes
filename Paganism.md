The word Pagan often has connotations in the modern day of [[devil]] worship. This has been propagated through modern day media and the word actually refers to those who believe in a faith not the [[Catholic Church]].

Paganism broadly speaking is a faith in [[nature]] and that all things that reside in it are profoundly spiritual.
