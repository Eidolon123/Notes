## Security Operations Centre

Standard methods no longer substantial enough to stop attacks ([[Antivirus|AV]] [[firewall]] etc). We now have to manually monitor traffic and alerts, then react to what the alerts say. The [[SOC team|team]] that takes up this task is called a SOC. They are the ones monitoring and responding to alerts coming from security systems. In this sense they are a virtual equivalent to a physical security control room.

The actions the SOC take can be proactive like a [[pentest]] or reactive.

The SOC will create, implement and enforce organisation [[security policies]].

There are many different [[Types of SOC]], whichever is being used depends on the use case of the client.
